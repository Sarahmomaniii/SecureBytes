# SecureBytes
 A Python-based tool that checks the strength of passwords and detects if they have been exposed in known data breaches.  

This Python script checks:
1. Password strength based on length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
2. If the password has appeared in known data breaches using the HaveIBeenPwned API.


Features
- Hide password input for privacy
- Rate password strength: Weak, Medium, Strong
- Check password leaks without sending it directly to the API
- Give tips for weak passwords
